## [1.0.1] – 2025-09-06
🚀 Big glow-up for Anon-Izzie!  

- Added **Range Mode** (salary-style anonymization with value bands) alongside Strict + Contextual  
- Fresh **Chrome Web Store screenshots** (clean, consistent, and fun)  
- Brand-new **header design** with tagline — Izzie finally gets her marketing moment 🎤  
- Compact, balanced **action buttons** (no more “giant purple bars of doom”)  
- UI polish: tightened spacing, smaller logs by default, cleaner file card styling  
- Hero thumbnail ready for the Web Store (logo on a bold gradient)  

💡 TL;DR: She’s prettier, more flexible, and one step closer to Chrome Web Store fame.
