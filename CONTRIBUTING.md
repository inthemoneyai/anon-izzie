# Contributing to Anon-Izzie

First off — thanks for even considering it!  

Anon-Izzie is a small, open-source project built to help equity, payroll, and HR folks anonymize spreadsheets before sharing or running them through AI tools. I maintain it in my (limited) spare time.

## How to Contribute

- **Issues**:  
  Spot a bug? Have a feature idea? Open an issue. Please include enough detail so I can actually reproduce what you’re seeing.

- **Pull Requests**:  
  PRs are welcome — just keep them small and focused. No giant rewrites, please.  
  Example: “Fix SS header false positive” ✅ vs. “Replace entire anonymizer with React app” ❌.

- **Style / Stack**:  
  - Plain JavaScript + CSS.  
  - No build step, no heavy frameworks.  
  - The goal is *fast and dead-simple*, not fancy.

## Boundaries

I may not merge everything (sometimes simpler really is better), but I genuinely appreciate every contribution.  

If your PR doesn’t land, it’s not personal — I just need to keep this tool lean and approachable.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind, be professional. No jerks allowed.  
If in doubt: anonymize your spreadsheets and chill. 🐿️
