# Security Policy

Anon-Izzie is a free, open-source Chrome extension. It anonymizes spreadsheets locally — no network calls, no data uploads, no creepy stuff.

That said, if you discover a security issue (even a tiny one), please let me know right away:

- **Email:** ap@inthemoney.ai

I take reports seriously and will respond as quickly as possible. Please don’t open GitHub issues for sensitive security bugs — email first.

## Supported Versions

Anon-Izzie is early and evolving. Only the **latest version** is supported — please update to the newest release before reporting bugs.

## Philosophy

This extension is intentionally minimal:
- ✅ No permissions requested beyond what’s needed to process files  
- ✅ No telemetry or analytics  
- ✅ 100% local processing  

If you ever find otherwise, that’s a bug. Please tell me.
